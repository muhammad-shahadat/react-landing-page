# ✨ React Landing Page (Practice Project) 

This is a **frontend practice project** — a responsive landing page built using **React + Vite**. The design was taken from a **Figma file provided by a YouTube tutorial**, and the purpose of this project is to strengthen React fundamentals and UI implementation skills.



## 📌 About

- This project is a **coding practice**, based on a **public Figma design** shared in a YouTube tutorial.
- All UI code was written by me, based on the structure and visuals from the Figma file and also help of the tutor.
- This is **not an original design**, and all design credit goes to the original designer and tutorial creator.
